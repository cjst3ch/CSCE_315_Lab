        <h3>Areas of interest</h3>
            <p>I have a huge interest and passion for CGI, special effects,
                and anything related to animation graphcs. This originates from watching movies as a kid
                with my dad. As I got older my love for movies slowly turned into a curriosity for how
                they were made. I started teaching myself the movie making process since 8th grade and
                eventually I came to discover the world of CGI and all things computer generated visuals.
                This was perfect for me because it was an amazing way to blend the interest in technology
                that had slowly started developing with my passion for movies and that type of
                storytelling. The goal for now is to eventually take the lead in major productions like
                Marvel films that really heavily on realistic CGI and computer simulations to make their
                films come to life.

    <h2>Service</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Together with Dr. Jose Luis Zelaya, I help students of hispanic immigrant families
            learn about and have the resources to navigate the world of higher education so
            they can bring generational change to themselves and their past and future generations
            of their families. This is something that being a first generation Latino student I
            wish my family and I had access to and therefore am extremely passionate about and
            grateful that I get to bring to the community.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>I have assisted my local church back home with media content by creating videos
            and photos for them to use to promote and create outreach within the community about
            everything the church has to offer them.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>I will be assisting as an RCIA discussion table leader at St. Mary's Catholic Center
            where I will help those interested in receiving their confirmation and continuing
            their journey in our faith through table discussions covering the topics from that
            week's seminar.
        </li>
